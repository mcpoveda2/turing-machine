# turing-machine
 Exploring mutable data struc- tures, composition, and inheritance of interface and implementing the turmach.model.Configuration interface as follows: class is called turmach.model.ConfigurationImpl The class is public and have a public constructor that takes as its argument a TuringMachine. Rather than an infinite tape , thetape maps int to char. Initially 1. Its tape contains only blank symbols. 2. The current position is 0 3. The current state is the initial symbol of its TuringMachine Turing Machine GUI Exploring graphical user inter- faces and call back functions.  GUI based on Swing.
